I am a geologist who studies the evolution of the Earth's surface.

I view the motion of tectonic plates as a series of incremental movements during large earthquakes along faults; building mountains, opening basins, and moving continents one rupture at a time through the millenia. These basins and mountains provide the diversity of environments that we live in. I study tectonics during the Quaternary, as much of the evidence of the interaction between tectonic and climatic processes from this period remains readily observable on the landscape. I combine satellite and aerial remote sensing, structural geology, paleoseismology, geomorphology, geochronology, and geophysics to study active tectonics and earthquake processes. 

I'm currently a postdoctoral research fellow working with the University of Oxford [Earthquakes and Active Tectonics](https://www.earth.ox.ac.uk/research-groups/active-tectonics-and-earthquakes-research/) group. I earned my PhD at the [Center for Neotectonic Studies](http://neotectonics.seismo.unr.edu/CNS_index.html) at the University of Nevada, Reno. I did my undergraduate studies at [Humboldt State University](https://geology.humboldt.edu/) in far Northern California, and grew up in [Santa Cruz, California](https://goo.gl/maps/mz88mCLBKzUNepdL6). 

In my spare time I like to take on impossibly ambitious design projects: like turning a retired army truck into a [fire-breathing whale](./photos/whale.jpg), or fabricating a [mobile field office](./photos/cyberroamer.jpg). I'm also fond of long road trips, more recently by [motorbike](./photos/moto.jpg).
