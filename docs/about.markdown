I am an earthquake geologist, geomorphologist, and remote sensing nerd. 

I view the motions of tectonic plates as a series of incremental movements during large earthquakes along faults; building mountains, opening basins, and moving continents one rupture at a time through the millenia. These basins and mountains provide the diversity of environments that we live in. I study tectonics during the Quaternary, as much of the evidence of the interaction between tectonic and climatic processes from this period remains readily observable on the landscape. I combine satellite and aerial remote sensing, structural geology, paleoseismology, geomorphology, geochronology, and geophysics to study active tectonics and earthquake processes. 

I'm currently a postdoctoral research fellow working with the University of Oxford [Earthquakes and Active Tectonics](https://www.earth.ox.ac.uk/research-groups/active-tectonics-and-earthquakes-research/) group.

In my spare time I like to take on impossibly ambitious design projects: like turning a retired army truck into a [fire-breathing whale](docs/photos/whale.jpg) or fabricating a [mobile field office](docs/photos/cyberroamer.jpg).
